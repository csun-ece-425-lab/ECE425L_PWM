 * @brief Source file for the PWM1_3 driver.
 *
 * This file contains the function definitions for the PWM1_3 driver.
 * It uses the Module 1 PWM Generator 3 to generate a PWM signal with the PB6 pin.
 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the system clock's frequency is 50 MHz.
 *
 * @note This driver assumes that the PWM_Clock_Init function has been called
 * before calling the PWM1_3_Init function.
